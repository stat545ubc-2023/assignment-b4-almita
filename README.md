# Assignment B4: Strings and functional programming in R

This repository covers my work for assignment B4 where I address two exercises:

-   Exercise 1: Take a book and make a plot of the most common words in the book, removing \"stop words\" of your choosing.

-   Exercise 3: Evaluate a model that\'s fit separately for each group in some dataset.

You can go through the exercises in either the `assignment-b4.md` file or the runnable R-markdown file `assignment-b4.Rmd` . The `files` folder contains the datasets and the scripts used to create them (in the case for the Spotify dataset). The `assignment-b4_files` folder contains the images for the plots produced in the exercises.
